## Start from Part1 - Beanfactory

This project will be a discovery of Springframework from a person who spends most of his time in the Front-end development landscape, wanting to discover **again** the horizon of wild-wilderness Back-end landscape via **Spring framework**.

It will start from the very beginning (**Bean factory** - although deprecated today) and going slowly up to the surface (**Spring Boot**).

The repo will be updated in a slow pace - **preferably one day at a time**.
