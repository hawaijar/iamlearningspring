## Start from Part1 - Beanfactory

This project will be a discovery of Springframework from a person who spends most of his time in the Front-end development landscape, wanting to discover **again** the horizon of wild-wilderness Back-end landscape via **Spring framework**.

It will start from the very beginning (**Bean factory** - although deprecated today) and going slowly up to the surface (**Spring Boot**).

The repo will be updated in a slow pace - **preferably one day at a time**.

### Setting up Spring framework on IntelliJ (CE)

Download the latest Spring Framework using this url - https://repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/ 

choose the zip file and download it (in my case, it's spring-5.2.7.RELEASE-dist.zip). Once you unzipped it, you'll find a **libs** folder where it'll have all the JAR files of Spring framework.

- Create a new Java project
- Click **File** --> Project Structure
- Click **Dependencies** (right panel) and down there's '+' icon
- Click the '+' icon and choose *JAR or directories...' and select all the JAR files from the Spring lib folder
